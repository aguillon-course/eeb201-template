# EEB201 Course Template

This is a template GitHub repository ("repo") for EEB 201. Each student in the course will use this to create their own repo to submit in-class assignments and at-home problem sets. Only the student and Stepfanie will have access to your repo. Be sure to "star" your repo to find it more easily in your personal GitHub account!
